<!-- this will display the code from whatever page I'm currently on hence it
prints hello about on the abouts page and hello contact on the contact page however I want to be able to put all the menu stuff like photos and links, etc in a partials controller  -->


For the repetition of the menu bar
# the comments function doesn't stop this from working
<!-- <% 9.times do %> -->
<!-- <% end %> -->


For linking
<!-- <p class="links"><%= @contact %></p>
<p class="links"><%= @about %></p> -->
